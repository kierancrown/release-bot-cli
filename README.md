## Installation (local, for yourself)

Clone this repo somewhere on your machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kierancrown/release-bot-cli.git
cd release-bot-cli
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Link the CLI locally (makes `releasebot` available on your PATH):

```bash
npm link
```

Now you can run `releasebot` from any repo on your machine.
(To remove: `npm unlink -g release-bot-cli`)

If you don‚Äôt want to link globally, you can also run it with:

```bash
npx ./bin/releasebot.mjs
```

---

## First Run Setup

On first run, the CLI will prompt for:

- **GitHub token** (required, read-only permissions are enough)
- **OpenAI API key** (optional, only needed for AI summaries)

These are saved to `~/.releasebot-cli/config.json`.
Environment variables (`GITHUB_TOKEN`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`) override config if set.

---

## Creating a GitHub token (fine-grained, recommended)

Follow these steps in your browser:

1. Go to [https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta)
   (this is the **fine-grained personal access token** page).

2. Press **Generate new token** ‚Üí **Fine-grained token**.

3. Fill in:
   - **Token name**: e.g. `release-bot-cli`
   - **Expiration**: choose a sensible expiry (e.g. 90 days or ‚ÄúNo expiration‚Äù if you rotate manually).

4. **Repository access**:
   - Choose **Only select repositories** ‚Üí tick the repositories you‚Äôll run this tool against.

5. **Permissions** (set to **Read-only** only):
   - **Pull requests** ‚Üí **Read-only**
   - **Contents** ‚Üí **Read-only** (optional but recommended to ensure commit message access)

6. Generate the token, copy it, and paste it into the prompt the first time you run `releasebot`.

That‚Äôs all ‚Äî no write or admin permissions are required.
